When in 1826 his mentor died, Nadorp broke his tents from Prague and returned in 1827 for a few months in his hometown district of Anholt in Isselburg. In the fall of 1827 Nadorp traveled with his companions Prince Franz of Salm-Salm to Rome.

Born in El Paso, Texas, White graduated from Dudley Primary School, El Paso High School, and the Citizens' Military Training Camp at San Antonio, Texas. Subsequently, from 1940 to 1942, he attended the University of Texas at El Paso, then known as Texas Western College. After his second year of college, White began his World War II service from 1942 to 1945 in the United States Marine Corps as a rifleman and Japanese-English interpreter in the Pacific Theater. As a result of injuries suffered, he was awarded the Purple Heart. Returning to Texas after the war, White received his bachelor's degree in 1946 from the University of Texas at Austin and his J.D. in 1949 from the University of Texas School of Law. He was admitted to the Texas state bar in 1949 and returned to El Paso to begin his legal career. He served two-year terms in the Texas House of Representatives, having been elected in 1954 and 1956. He was the El Paso County Democratic chairman from 1963 to 1965. He was elected to the historic Eighty-ninth Congress as part of the national 1964 Democratic surge linked to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's crushing defeat of Republican U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. White, who received more votes than Johnson did in the 16th District, played his part by unseating freshman Republican Ed Foreman of Odessa in the 16th Congressional District. During his first term, White represented a monstrous district stretching from El Paso all the way to the Permian Basin\u2014a distance of over 42,000 square miles. However, after Texas' congressional map was thrown out in Wesberry v. Sanders, his district was cut down to El Paso and a few inner-ring suburbs. He was reelected eight times from this district with almost no difficulty. As a U.S. representative, White developed a reputation as a moderate Democrat. He also chaired the Democratic Research Organization, a group within the party that distributed information from the leadership relevant to pending votes. Having Fort Bliss in the 16th Congressional District made White a natural choice for his place on the House Armed Services Committee. There he chaired the Military Personnel Subcommittee and was also instrumental in reorganization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He also served for a while on the Interior, Post Office & Civil Service, and Science & Technology committees. Choosing not to run again in 1982, White returned to his hometown of El Paso to resume his law practice. White was married twice. His first marriage in 1949 to Katherine Huffman produced three sons, Rodrick, Richard, and Raymond. After her death in 1972, White married the former Kathleen Fitzgerald in 1973. The second marriage produced one daughter, Bonnie, two sons, Sean and Brian, and one step-son, Kenneth. White died on February 18, 1998.

During these years, Lubken took thousands of photographs documenting the Reclamation Service's irrigation projects across the American West. He recorded the progress of construction projects as well as USRS machinery and personnel. The agency also asked Lubken to photograph nearby towns and farms for a series of articles designed to promote settlement on land reclaimed from the desert through irrigation. Traveling with his large camera and glass-plate negatives, he documented 25 projects in 17 Western States. After leaving the Reclamation Service in 1917, Lubken left professional photography until the 1930s, when he photographed the building of Boulder Dam. Lubken's photographs capture both engineering feats and everyday life in the early 20th-century West. His optimistic images impress the viewer with the technological and social advances made by westerners. They make the point that progress and community had come to isolated, formerly barren places, and that abundant opportunities awaited those willing to move west and work hard on the reclaimed land. Walter was born Walter John Lubken, the fourth of six children on 24 August 1882 in Boise, Idaho, to George Lubken, a German baker from New York City, and Hellena Aldelmann. He married Alice Cornelia (Hoagland) Hall, a divorcee, the daughter of John Aaron Hoagland (1861\u20131929) and Harriet Maria Louditt Rupp (1862\u20131949), of LDS Church fame, on 4 December 1911 in Boise, Ada, Idaho. They had no children, but Walter did assist in the raising of Alice's only child by her former marriage to Alva Archer Hall (1877\u20131942). After photography, Walter went back to a former career working as a dry goods store clerk, which profession he apparently was more proud of than his short stint with fame as the \\\"Government Photographer,\\\" and died quietly in his home town of Boise some time in June 1960 at the age of 77 according to the 1 July 1960 AP Wire.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Walter_Lubken", "word_count": 327, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Walter Lubken"}

His first victories came in 1958 at the Nuvolari trophy in Barcelona and the Rally Catalunya. This allowed him some sponsorship to enter the Monte Carlo Rally. In 1968 raced the 24 Hours of Le Mans with team Porsche driving a 907/6 Langheck and a year later in the 24 Hours of Daytona, where he led his class until his co-driver Rudy Lins had an accident. In the same year he finished 4th in the 12 Hours of Sebring with a Porsche 907. That same year enters the F2 championship driving a Lola, and in 1969 placed seventh in Barcelona Grand Prix in a Lotus F2 from Roy Winckelman Team led by Bernie Ecclestone. Achieved victories in several races with Jochen Rindt on the 6 Hours of Jarama and second in the 1000 km of Buenos Aires. His first race in Formula 1 was at the 1970 Spanish Grand Prix with a Lotus 49. Race organisers limited the race to 16 starters, resulting in Soler-Roig failing to qualify, despite lapping only a tenth of a second slower than Mario Andretti. However, on race morning there was a suggestion that the non-qualifiers might be allowed to start after all, so their cars were placed on the grid, only for the organisers to stick to their original decision, removing Soler-Roig's car from the grid as well as those of Jo Siffert and Andrea de Adamich. He subsequently participated at the Belgian Grand Prix, driving the Lotus 72 that was meant for Jochen Rindt. However, the car was not ready for Friday\u00b4s practice and he only managed to complete three laps in Saturday's qualifying, and was therefore not allowed to start the race. His final Formula One outing for the season was another non-qualification at the French Grand Prix in a 49. He won the Spanish GT-Sport Championship that same year. He started the 1971 season driving for the works March team, combining the Formula 1 Championship with the Spanish and German Touring Car Championships with Ford Capri. He won the Spanish Championship and finished fourth in Germany, but failed to finish any races in Formula 1. Soler-Roig joined the Marlboro BRM F1 team for the 1972 season, but after a few races with problems in the car and the team, decided to spend the rest of the year racing the European Touring Car Championship with Ford, getting great results and victories in the 24 Hours of Spa, the 24 Hours of Paul Ricard, the 4 Hours of Zandvoort, 4 Hours of Jarama and the 3 Hours of Montjuich. His withdrawal from the world of competition occurred at the end of 1972, before his 41st birthday, to pursue his family business.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "RacingDriver", "l3": "FormulaOneRacer", "wiki_name": "Alex_Soler-Roig", "word_count": 519, "label": "Formula One Racer", "people": "Alex Soler-Roig"}

The gyroscope was invented by Leon Foucault in 1851 but industry ignored the device for nearly 50 years. In 1895 or 1896, Obry rediscovered Foucault's device and adapted it into a mechanism for steering a torpedo. This increased the weapon's accuracy from hundreds to thousands of yards. Obry then patented his device and sold the rights to Robert Whitehead, who incorporated the mechanism into the Whitehead torpedo. The device consisted of a bronze wheel weighing less than 1.5 pounds that was spun by an air jet. Obry's device was notable for solving many problems; how to get the gyroscope to begin rotating as quickly as possible, how to direct the vertical rudders and how to maintain the fast rotation of the rotor.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Ludwig_Obry", "word_count": 146, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Ludwig Obry"}

{"text": "Jon Hess is an American martial artist, early mixed martial arts competitor and the co-founder of the Scientifically Aggressive Fighting Technology of America, or S.A.F.T.A., a martial art with roots in San Soo Kung Fu. Hess, along with S.A.F.T.A. co-founder Lew Hicks, were students of Jerry Peterson, the founder of S.C.A.R.S. They took their San Soo Kung Fu black belt test together in 1993, and Hicks was chosen by Hess to corner him for the UFC. Hess's mixed martial arts debut came in the Ultimate Fighting Championship 5 tournament, where he defeated Andy Anderson by TKO at one minute twenty-two seconds into the fight. The fight is regarded as one of the dirtiest in UFC history, and Hess was ultimately fined $2,000 for two violations of the rules against eye gouging. Hess has defended his actions, citing that \\\"The UFC billed itself as no rules,\\\" and therefore there were no rules to break. However, despite the marketing slogan, early UFC events did have a limited list of forbidden techniques, though infractions could only result in a fine. After victory over Anderson, Hess withdrew from the tournament with a hand injury. After his appearance in the UFC, Hess struggled to find another fight, despite publicly challenging dominant early UFC competitor Royce Gracie. Hess believes that this is because he was blacklisted by UFC promoter Art Davie  After an attempt to gain public support for a return to the UFC via opinions published in Inside Kung Fu magazine  Hess fought Vitor Belfort at SB 2-SuperBrawl 2, where he lost by KO in 12 seconds. Hess has not fought professionally since this loss, but has stated he took the Belfort fight on short notice, that if he was allowed to come back he would be \\\"world champ\\\", and that Belfort was \\\"on steroids\\\" when he beat him. On April 25, 2010 Hess cornered Team Quest fighter Steven Tobias at Gladiator Challenge where Tobias won his first pro fight. Since 2007, Hess has made several efforts to get into fighting shape and has suffered a number of injuries including breaking three toes and an ankle.

With the exception of a short spell with Scottish club Hibernian in 1978, \\\"Matta\\\" played for IK Start throughout his career, where he won the Norwegian league title in 1978 and 1980. Mathisen was capped 25 times for Norway, scoring twice, but many claim that he never reached his full potential for the national team. Playing attacking midfielder or striker, Mathisen was a creative player popular among the fans in Kristiansand, although there was a widespread feeling that he maybe paid too little attention to defensive play. In total he played 327 top-tier league matches, and scored 106 goals. Both numbers are club records, and when he retired in 1989 he also held the domestic \\\"matches played\\\" record. It has later been beaten by Ola By Rise, Roar Strand, Christer Basma, Erik Hoftun and Bj\u00f8rn Johansen. In 2010, Mathisen was diagnosed with stomach cancer, and began treatment for it, but he continued to play football and appear on television. In an interview with Verdens Gang, Mathisen said the sickness had taught him to love the little things in life, and that he was optimistic about his recovery. Svein Mathisen died in his sleep from cancer in the early hours of 27 January 2011, nearly six months after being diagnosed. His last public appearance had been at a local football tournament just a few days prior. Several football personalites expressed grief over his death, and his old club IK Start cancelled all activities for the day.

He was immediately assigned to the rookie level Grand Junction Rockies, where he went 3-2 with a 3.97 earned run average and 78 strikeouts in 79\u2153 innings. Johnson gained a promotion to Single-A Asheville Tourists for 2006, and had a 13-5 record with a 4.04 ERA while striking out 123 in 160\u2153 innings.

Late in the year, he finished 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA in two starts for Double-A Tulsa Drillers. But Johnson declined in 2008 with Tulsa, where he went 4-14 with a 5.23 ERA in 28 starts, striking out 92 in 175\u2154 innings. Even though, he was promoted to Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox in 2009, where he went 10-6 with a 5.66 ERA in 26 games (24 starts), and strike out 76 in 143 innings. Johnson came back with the Sky Sox in 2010, finishing 10-8 with a 5.91 ERA in 28 games (25 starts), and striking out 100 in 141\u2154 innings.

Bewick was born in 1935 in England, and with her mother Harry and sister Hazel, moved many times between England and Ireland, before finally settling in County Kerry where she now lives and works, near Caragh Lake. She claims to be distantly related to actress Meryl Streep, through her mother. She is a descendant of 19th-century artist Thomas Bewick. In her teens Bewick started studying at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, and after graduation, moved to London. During her time there she illustrated a children's animated television series for the BBC, and also produced illustrations for books and magazines. On her return to Dublin she took jobs in singing and acting, and in 1957 opened her first exhibition there. She married her husband Pat in 1963, and gave birth to two daughters, Poppy and Holly. During the 1970s, she got to know folk singer Luke Kelly in Dublin and had a sexual affair with him. She had another affair with a local man during a stay with her daughters in Samoa in 1989; when she returned she discovered Pat was also having an affair, which she accepted. By 2015, Pat had contracted Alzheimer's disease. A prolific artist, Bewick paints in oil, sculpts, and works with cloth, but is most associated with watercolours.

On February 15, 2013, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced that Guerin had been elected as one of its 2013 inductees. He served in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1947 to 1954. While a reservist, Guerin attended Iona College from 1950 to 1954 where he scored 1,375 points in 67 games playing for coach Jim McDermott. After graduation, Guerin served on active duty at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia for two years. The Knicks drafted Guerin with the 8th pick in the second round of the 1954 NBA draft while still on active duty. After leaving the Marine Corps, Guerin would begin his professional basketball career in 1956. As a high-scoring point guard in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Richie Guerin was one of the most talented and best-loved players ever to wear a New York Knicks jersey. His feisty on-court style and wisecracking off-court demeanor played well to Madison Square Garden crowds. Guerin was a machinelike scorer, a gifted passer, a smart playmaker, and one of the best rebounding and driving guards of his era. He led the Knicks in assists for five consecutive seasons and in scoring three times during his seven full seasons in the Big Apple, and he tallied more than 20 points per game in four consecutive years. The explosive Guerin also set Knicks single-game records for scoring, with 57 points in 1959, and assists, with 21 in 1958. His 57-point game stood as a Knicks record until Carmelo Anthony scored 62 in 2014. A fan and media favorite, Guerin played in six consecutive NBA All-Star Games. As a team, however, New York struggled, reaching the playoffs only once during Guerin's tenure. He was traded to the St. Louis Hawks midway through the 1963\u201364 season and spent the next eight years as the team's player-coach and then head coach. With St. Louis (and eventually Atlanta), Guerin played alongside such greats as Bob Pettit, Lou Hudson, Lenny Wilkens, and Cliff Hagan.

Shapiro began his competitive cycling career at the age of thirteen. During his career as both a top amateur and professional racer, Shapiro competed in many countries throughout the world. Shapiro was a member of the American Olympic Team in 1980, but was not able to participate due to United States participation in the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. He was a member of the 1984 American Olympic team. In 1980, he received a Congressional Gold Medal at the White House due to the 1980 Olympic Boycott. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress, and this corrective measure was long overdue given the sacrifice by the American Olympic team. The medals awarded to members of the 1980 team hold the same standing as the ones awarded to such luminaries as George Washington, who was so honored on March 25, 1776. In 1984 Shapiro won American's top cycling stage race, the Coors Classic - riding for the 7-Eleven racing team.

Born in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn in 1874, Fitzsimmons began his career in 1885 working at a racetrack as a stable boy. After nearly ten less-than-successful years as a thoroughbred jockey, he became too heavy for that job and took up the training of horses. He went on to have one of the most successful careers in racing history that spanned seventy years from 1894\u20131963 and produced 2,275 race wins. Known both as \\\"Sunny Jim\\\" and as \\\"Mr. Fitz\\\", he trained three Kentucky Derby winners, four Preakness Stakes winners, and six Belmont Stakes winners. Included were two U.S. Triple Crown champions, Gallant Fox in 1930 and Omaha in 1935. His total of thirteen Classic wins was tied by D. Wayne Lukas in 2000 and broken by Lukas in 2013. Five times, Fitzsimmons was the season's top money-winning trainer. In 1923 Jim Fitzsimmons took over training at Belair Stud. Following the death of William Woodward, Jr., Belair's owner, in 1955 and the dispersal of its stock, Fitzsimmons continued to train for the Wheatley Stable where he conditioned Preakness winner and 1957 American Horse of the Year Bold Ruler, who sired Secretariat. In recognition of his accomplishments, in 1958 Fitzsimmons was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. The National Turf Writers Association created an award in his name called the \\\"Mr. Fitz Award\\\" to honor a member of the horse racing fraternity each year.

In fact, he also holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space.

{"text": "Sir George Cunningham Buchanan (20 April 1865 \u2013 14 April 1940) was a British civil engineer particularly associated with harbour works in Burma, Iraq and Bombay, during the early years of the 20th century. Buchanan first came to prominence in 1905 when he collaborated with Patrick Meik on designs for the Rangoon River training works in Burma; Meik was consulting engineer and Buchanan was chief engineer. The project reclaimed some 1.2 km\u00b2 of land behind a wall of rubble 2 miles (3.2 km) long and 230 feet (70 m) wide. At the start of the First World War in 1914, Buchanan was working in India, until called to support the British Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force at Basra in Mesopotamia (now part of modern-day Iraq) with advice on improving shipping channels into the port. After many delays, he was finally able to design and supervise construction of a line of wharves complete with cranes, sheds, roads and railway lines. In 1917, Buchanan was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was knighted. However, he had already distanced himself from his compatriots by his reputation for egotism and outspokenness, and jealousy of his enormous salary as Director-General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. His military counterpart, General MacMunn, wrote that he: \\\"irritated everyone who came across him or worked for him\\\". Buchanan later wrote a critical book about the military campaign and his own part in turning it around, The Tragedy of Mesopotamia (1938). Buchanan was a member of the Indian Munitions Board from 1917 \u2013 1919. In 1920, working with Patrick\u2019s brother Charles Meik in a firm renamed CS Meik and Buchanan in 1920, Buchanan was invited to Bombay to investigate a potential land reclamation project, the Bombay Backbay reclamation. The costs of the huge and ambitious scheme, and the time it would take to complete, soon escalated out of control, and a subsequent enquiry blamed Sir George (the project became known as Lloyd\u2019s Folly, after Sir George Lloyd, then governor of Bombay). At the same time, Sir George Buchanan was alleged to have \u201ccriticised and condemned the proposals of another engineer and had offered his services uninvited\u201d \u2013 an action which saw him expelled from the British Institution of Civil Engineers. His later career was largely focused overseas, notably in Australia where he prepared an influential report on the country's ports in 1926 at the request of the Federal Government. His ignominious departure from UK engineering circles meant that the name 'Buchanan' had to be deleted from the company name in 1923 when the firm became CS Meik and Halcrow (William Halcrow had been a partner in the firm from the previous year and went on to take a more controlling interest in what became the Halcrow Group).

As Voris Marker, she also worked as a sculptor. Born Voris Linthacum in Baker City, Oregon according to her marriage certificate, but growing up on a ranch near Billings, Montana, Voris worked as a copy-writer for an advertising agency in Chicago after finishing school in Montana. While in Chicago, she had to have an operation on her leg, which led to her returning home as an invalid. Whilst recuperating, Voris came across a piece of soft chamois leather, which inspired her to use it to make up clothing. She made a golf skirt for a Spokane woman to wear in a tournament. Other players and spectators noticed the skirt, and asked Voris to make them leather garments too. She founded her business, Suedes by Voris, in 1933, and by 1940, had shops in Hollywood (where she sold garments to many actors) and across the South West, selling a wide range of clothing entirely made in suede. Her range included day and evening wear, hats, jewelry, and men's jackets, shirts, and ties, made in a wide range of colors. One noted design was a gold-plated evening jacket. When the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli visited Neiman Marcus and was invited to choose any one thing she wanted from the store; she chose a Voris coat as \\\"the most distinctive fashion she had ever seen by an American designer.\\\" It has been suggested that this inspired the decision to award Voris the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1942. Voris later gave up the business to dedicate herself to sculpting. Following her receipt of the Neiman Marcus award, she was commissioned to create a bronze portrait of Herbert Marcus, the co-founder of the store.

Jon Stewart (born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz, November 28, 1962) is an American comedian, writer, producer, director, actor, media critic, and former television host.

Stewart started as a stand-up comedian, but branched into television as host of Short Attention Span Theater for Comedy Central. He went on to host his own show on MTV, The Jon Stewart Show, and then hosted You Wrote It, You Watch It, also on MTV. He has also had several film roles as an actor, but has done few cinematic projects since becoming the host of The Daily Show in 1999. He was also a writer and co-executive producer of the show. After Stewart joined, The Daily Show steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, and his work won 22 Primetime Emmy Awards. Stewart has gained acclaim as an acerbic, satirical critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular those of the U.S. media networks such as CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his \\\"fake news\\\" desk. Stewart agrees, saying that neither his show nor his channel purports to be anything other than satire and comedy. In spite of its self-professed entertainment mandate, The Daily Show has been nominated for news and journalism awards. Stewart hosted the 78th and 80th Academy Awards. He is the co-author of America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction, which was one of the best-selling books in the U.S. in 2004, and Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race, released in 2010. Stewart announced on February 10, 2015, during a taping of The Daily Show, that he would leave the show before the end of 2015, but assured fans that he was not retiring and suggested that he would continue writing and may return to stand-up comedy or as a part-time correspondent.

{"text": "Marvin Camras (1916\u20131995) was an electrical engineer and inventor who was widely influential in the field of magnetic recording. Camras built his first recording device, a wire recorder, in the 1930s for a cousin who was an aspiring singer. Shortly afterwards he discovered that using magnetic tape made the process of splicing and storing recordings easier. Camras's work attracted the notice of his professors at what is now Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and was offered a position at Armour Research Foundation (which merged with Lewis Institute in 1940 to become IIT) to develop his work. Before and during World War II Camras' early wire recorders were used by the armed forces to train pilots. They were also used for disinformation purposes: battle sounds were recorded and amplified and the recordings placed where the D-Day invasion was not going to take place. This work was kept secret until after the war. In June 1944 he was awarded U.S. Patent 2,351,004, titled \\\"Method and Means of Magnetic Recording\\\". In all, Camras received more than 500 patents, largely in the field of electronic communications. Camras received a bachelor's degree in 1940 and a master's degree in 1942, both in electrical engineering, from IIT. In 1968, the institution awarded him an honorary doctorate. In May 1962 Camras wrote a predictive paper titled \\\"Magnetic recording and reproduction - 2012 A.D.\\\". In his paper Camras predicted the existence of mass-produced portable media players he described as memory packs the size of a package of playing cards holding up to 1020 bits of information. Such devices would not have any mechanically moving parts and would store both sound and movies. He also predicted music and movie downloads, online shopping, access to online encyclopedias and newspapers and the widespread use of online banking transactions.

In August 1933, Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey called his counterpart with the Cubs, William Veeck, Sr. and offered him two pitchers\u2014Heise and Bill Lee. According to Bill Veeck, one of Rickey's favorite tricks was to offer another team two players and trust that the other team would take the wrong one. In the case of Lee and Heise, Rickey knew that all but one Cubs pitcher was right-handed, and expected the Cubs to take Heise, a left-hander. However, on the advice of chief scout Jack Doyle, the Cubs took Lee. The trade proved to be one of the most lopsided trades of the 1930s, and one of the few instances where Rickey, well known for fleecing other National League teams, got fleeced himself. Heise appeared in only one game during the 1934 season, allowing three hits and three runs in two innings of relief in what would be his only major league action. He was sent back to the minors after the season, and spent the next two years in the Cardinals and Chicago White Sox organizations before retiring.

{"text": "Lee Weiss (born 1928 in Inglewood, California), is an American painter. She attended California College of Arts and Crafts for a year, studied under Nels Eric Oback, and was critiqued by Alexander Nepote. However, for the most part, Weiss is a self taught artist. She won numerous watercolor awards, as well as exhibiting in the White House Rotating Exhibition Program. She painted her impressions of a space shuttle launch in 1984, under the auspices of the NASA art program. To achieve the specific textural qualities that she felt watercolor lacked, Weiss invented a watercolor technique in which she paints both sides of the paper, turning the paper back and forth while the paint is still wet. That way, the paint from one side transfers to the table and then to the other side of the paper, along with some of the table's texture. This process is continued until an adequate surface has been built up to suggest a subject and composition. In general, she works away from the subject matter, in the studio without sketches or slides, allowing the process of painting to guide the portrayal. She also works in a more traditional manner, foregoing the surface treatment of the paper, and starting directly with a brush and subject. Her work is part of over sixty corporate and museum collections. She has held solo exhibitions in California, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as taking part in group exhibitions in Japan and France.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "Lee_Weiss", "word_count": 244, "label": "Painter", "people": "Lee Weiss"}
