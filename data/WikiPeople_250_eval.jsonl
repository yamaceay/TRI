{"text": "Stephen J. Gordon (born 4 September 1986) is a chess grandmaster from Oldham, Greater Manchester, England. In September 2004 he took a break from his A-level studies at The Blue Coat School, Oldham to compete in the thirteenth Monarch Assurance Isle of Man International. In 2005, while still a FIDE Master, he finished 6th in the British Championships ahead of a Grandmaster and several International Masters. At the EU Individual Open Chess Championship held at Liverpool in 2006, he led the tournament after eight rounds and finished a very creditable (joint) second, a half point behind winner Nigel Short and level with Luke McShane among others. Probably his best result to date however, was second place in the 2007 British Championship, narrowly losing his share of the lead in the final round. In previous rounds, he defeated both tournament victor Jacob Aagaard and previous champion Jonathan Rowson. By 2008, his rating had reached grandmaster level, although the title itself had not yet been secured. At the British Championship in Liverpool, he almost repeated his performance of the previous year, by taking a share of third place. He was the British under-21 Champion each consecutive year between 2005 and 2008. He became a grandmaster on 1 August 2009. He has been one of the co-presenters of the chess podcast The Full English Breakfast since its inaugural show in October 2010.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "Stephen_J._Gordon", "word_count": 229, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "Stephen J.

He was born in Monocacy, Pennsylvania. His pro career began when he was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics as a free agent before the 1936 season, at the age of 18. Even before that, he threw batting practice for the Athletics in Shibe Park as far back as 1934 before he was signed to the team. He pitched three seasons of relief in Philadelphia before being traded to the New York Yankees in July 1939. Gumpert spent a few years in the minors before deciding to enter military service. He served in World War II as a member of the United States Coast Guard. After finishing his time in the military, he was able to make it to the major league roster for the 1946 season. He played well in his first season as a Yankee, earning an 11\u20133 record with an earned run average of 2.31. Gumpert played fewer innings the following season, but still received a 4\u20131 record. He continued being a relief pitcher for part of the 1948 season before he was purchased by the Chicago White Sox. He finished the 1948 season in the starting rotation for the White Sox. He spent the 1949 season in the starting rotation as well, and managed to keep his spot throughout the year despite allowing the most home runs in the American League. It was also the one season where Gumpert pitched over 200 innings, pitching 234, and the season where he pitched the most complete games and shutouts, with 18 and 3, respectively.

A chess prodigy, he is considered by many as one of the greatest players of all time, widely renowned for his exceptional endgame skill and speed of play. Born in Havana, he beat Cuban champion Juan Corzo in a match at the age of 13 years. His victory over Frank Marshall in a match in 1909 earned him an invitation to the 1911 San Sebastian tournament, which he won ahead of players such as Akiba Rubinstein, Aron Nimzowitsch and Siegbert Tarrasch. During the next several years, Capablanca had a strong series of tournament results. After several unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match with the then world champion Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca finally won the title from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated for 8 years from February 10, 1916 to March 21, 1924, a period which included the world championship match with Lasker. Capablanca lost the title in 1927 to Alexander Alekhine, who had never beaten Capablanca before the match. Following unsuccessful attempts to arrange a return match over many years, relations between them became bitter. Capablanca continued his excellent tournament results in this period but withdrew from serious chess in 1931. He made a comeback in 1934, with some good results, but also showed symptoms of high blood pressure. He died in 1942 of \\\"a cerebral hemorrhage provoked by hypertension\\\". Capablanca excelled in simple positions and endgames; Bobby Fischer described him as possessing a \\\"real light touch\\\". He could play tactical chess when necessary, and had good defensive technique. He wrote several chess books during his career, of which Chess Fundamentals was regarded by Mikhail Botvinnik as the best chess book ever written. Capablanca preferred to not present detailed analysis but focused on critical moments in a game. His style of chess was influential in the play of future world champions Bobby Fischer and Anatoly Karpov.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "Jos\u00e9_Ra\u00fal_Capablanca", "word_count": 332, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca"}

He raced in the USRRC series, the CanAm Series and the L&M Continental Series (Formula 5000). In the USRRC he drove for Nickey Chevrolet in a Dan Blocker, of Bonanza fame, sponsored Genie/Vinegaroon In the first year of the Can Am he was the top finishing Canadian propelled by a fourth-place finish in the opening event at his home course, St Jovite. Cannon duplicated that accomplishment in 1968 propelled by a famous win over the dominant McLaren team in a very wet race at Laguna Seca. He also attained top Canadian status in 1973. Cannon also ran in the Continental Series (Formula 5000) in 1969 and 1970 where he was champion in 1970, driving for St Louis trucking magnate Carl Hogan, in the Hogan-Starr racing McLaren M-10B. Racing in the following Tasman series in 1971, Cannon made the M10 fast but unreliable at Levin and Wigram but against the larger field of talented drivers in the Australian races found the local experience of Matich, Allen, Gardner, Bartlett and McRae very difficult for any American to match, first time in the Antipodes. Cannon participated in one World Championship Formula One Grand Prix, on October 3, 1971 in the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. He finished 14th, thus he scored no championship points. He also participated in one non-Championship Formula One race, the Questor Grand Prix, finishing up in 12th. During 1971 he also ran strongly in a number of rounds of the European F2 championship, impressing many. Cannon also made 15 starts in the USAC Championship Car series while driving on a part-time basis from 1968 to 1974. His best finish was 2nd place in the second race at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in 1968. He also finished a career best 27th in series points that year. He also attempted to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 in 1970 and 1974 but failed to make the race both years. In 1975-76 he returned to US F5000 series with a March 741 modified for F5000, and ran in midfield, with best results 4th at Riverside in 1975 and 6th on the same track in 1976 in the last US F5000 races. Although Cannon,held the Ferrari dealership for LA, finance and engine costs limited his form in highly competitive final years of US F5000, however he proved competitive when he ran a few rounds in the UK Shellsport F5000/F1/Libre series in 1976 and ran the Australian F5000 Rothmans series at the start of 1976 proving as fast as the best Australian F5000 drivers Goss and Schuppan and actually won one round. His last serious racing was two years later in the Australian Rothmans, aged 45 where he managed a single, third place, purely on reliability He was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame in 1993.It is widely thought that had Cannon entered the sport seriously at an early age, he might have had a significant F1 career. His son Michael has built a career as a race engineer. During the 2006 season at Forsythe Racing in the Champ Car World Series he was race engineer for A. J. Allmendinger.

Chen Changxing is a slightly mysterious character and much controversy surrounds him. He is most known as the teacher of the great taijiquan master Yang Luchan, but there is much disagreement over which style of martial art Chen Changxing actually taught to the family outsider. Some schools of thought suggest that Chen Changxing was a maverick who practiced and taught a style of martial art that was not part of the Chen Family martial arts tradition, and that was passed to him either directly or indirectly from a taijiquan master known as Jiang Fa. Other schools of thought suggest that Chen Changxing re-worked two or more of the traditional Chen Family routines into his own style and then taught it to Yang Luchan and others. Both schools successfully explain why the taijiquan that Yang Luchan's descendants now practice is substantially different from the modern Chen routines, but neither theory can be completely substantiated and thus much controversy remains. Chen Changxing is said to have been of an irreverent character and was given the nickname \\\"Mr Ancestral Tablet\\\" due to the directness of his posture.

Gurney was the son of John Gurney (1845\u20131887), a member of the influential Quaker Gurney banking family, and Isabel Blake-Humfrey. He joined the diplomatic service and served in various early postings in Europe. From 1911 he worked as secretary to the British Embassy in Berlin. Following the outbreak of WWI, he was appointed as First Secretary to the Embassy in Copenhagen on 16 August 1914, where he served through most of the conflict. Gurney was not popular at Copenhagen where he was accused of being timid and lacking in judgement by Ambassador Ralph Paget. When Paget took up the position of Ambassador to Brazil in the summer of 1918, the Foreign Office in London decided to remove Gurney from Copenhagen as well due to his being almost universally disliked by his subordinates. On 10 July 1918 Lord Kilmarnock replaced Gurney as First Secretary. This highly unusual move of replacing the First Secretary at the same time as the Ambassador threatened to cut short Gurney's advancement and diplomatic career, but the crisis eventually passed. Hugh Gurney returned to Copenhagen as Ambassador to Denmark in his own right in 1933, serving until 1935. He also followed in Paget's footsteps, serving as Ambassador to Brazil from 1935 to 1939.

{"text": "Andre Kirk Agassi (born April 29, 1970) is an American retired professional tennis player and former World No. 1, who was one of the game's most dominant players from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s. Generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Agassi had been called the greatest service returner in the history of the game. Described by the BBC upon his retirement as \\\"perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport's history\\\", Agassi compiled performances that, along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude, saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game. As a result, he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s. In singles tennis, Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist, as well as finishing runner-up in seven other Grand Slam tournaments. During the Open Era, Agassi is the first male player to win 4 Australian Open titles and those were an Open Era record until Novak Djokovic won his 5th title on February 1, 2015. Agassi is one of five male singles players to achieve the Career Grand Slam in the Open Era and one of eight in history, the first of two to achieve the Career Golden Slam (Career Grand Slam and Olympic Gold Medal), and the only man to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships (won in 1990): a distinction dubbed as a \\\"Career Super Slam\\\" by Sports Illustrated. Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and the last American male to win the French Open, in 1999 and the Australian Open (2003). He also won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of a winning Davis Cup team in 1990, 1992 and 1995. Agassi reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to World No. 141 in 1997, prompting many to believe that his career was over. Agassi returned to World No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years. During his 20-plus year tour career, Agassi was known by the nickname \\\"The Punisher\\\". After suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a spondylolisthesis (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve, Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the US Open to Benjamin Becker. He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60 million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada. In 2001, the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a K-12 public charter school for at-risk children.

He was born in London while his father, Hugh Cameron, was serving in the Army during World War II. Cameron was raised by his grandmother, Isabella 'Bella' Cameron, in the Royal Burgh of Rutherglen, south-east of Glasgow, Scotland. Prior to pursuing this career he had worked for a time with the Glasgow-based structural engineering firm, Sir William Arrol & Co. and for Glasgow Corporation Transport. He entered show business when he was 32, initially working in clubs. His act as a football hooligan led to him becoming a top comedy act in Scottish football clubs. He is probably best known for writing and performing the football anthem \\\"Ally's Tartan Army\\\" for the Scotland national football team's appearance at the 1978 World Cup. It went to #6 in the UK Singles Chart and led to two appearances on Top of the Pops in 1978. Cameron promptly put all of the profits from his single into producing an album, which he hoped to release while the World Cup fever in Scotland was still going strong. He was too late - Scotland team went out of the World Cup early and Cameron's album fared equally badly. Andy also released a song in the 70's for his beloved Glasgow Rangers - 'The Greatest Team of All' - which still appears on the odd Rangers compilation album. In 1975 he came second in New Faces leading to several appearances on variety shows such as Live at Her Majesty\u2019s with Jimmy Tarbuck and Tarby and Friends. In 1979, soon after the establishment of BBC Radio Scotland, he was given a thirteen-week contract to present a programme of music and humour. The show eventually ran for fifteen years. He was voted Radio Personality of the year in 1984. He had his own series on BBC Scotland in 1979 and again in 1982. He was awarded Scottish Television Personality of the Year for his 1983 series called It\u2019s Andy Cameron. In the early 1980s he was invited to speak in debates at Cambridge and Oxford Universities alongside Arnold Brown and James Naughtie. Cameron is a well-known celebrity Rangers F.C. supporter. In the early 1980s however he caused some controversy by attacking the club's anti-catholic signing policies at an Annual General Meeting of the club. In 1984, Cameron presented STV's Hogmanay show. The following year he presented the BBC Scotland Hogmanay show, and continued to do so until 1989. His last Hogmanay appearance was in 1990, in a short programme called Andy's Scottish Filling which preceded the live BBC Hogmanay Show. In 1994 Cameron joined the cast of Take the High Road, the STV soap. He played a character called Chic Cherry, until the last episode in 2003. He currently works as an after dinner speaker, and has a 'stand-up' act before Rangers F.C.'s home league matches. Furthermore, he presented a show on Clyde 2 on Sunday afternoons until that show ended in late 2009 when he was replaced by Tom Ferrie, whose show is now networked by two or three others Scottish radio stations.

By the end of his career, his fashion house employed 1,200 people and its impact on fashion taste was far-reaching. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has said that his \\\"aggressive self-promotion\\\" earned him the title of the first couturier. Certainly, by the 1870s, his name was not just known in court circles, but appeared in women's magazines that were read by wide society. Worth raised the status of dressmaking so that the designer-maker also became arbiter of what women should be wearing.

Cuitt was born at Moulton, in Yorkshire, and having shown a natural taste for drawing and design was sent to Italy at the expense of Sir Lawrence Dundas, whose family had already been painted by him. He studied earnestly for six years at Rome, and also pursued landscape painting, a branch of art that was more congenial to his tastes. He returned to England in 1775, and in 1776 he exhibited at the Royal Academy 'The Infant Jupiter fed with goat's milk and honey.' He afterwards exhibited portraits and landscapes, his last contribution being in 1798. Owing to frequent attacks of low fever he was unable to reside in London, and he finally settled at Richmond in Yorkshire. Here he found constant employment in the commissions given hira by gentlemen whose parks and residences were in his neighbourhood. His death occurred in 1818. His portraits are elaborately finished, although very thinly painted, whilst his earlier landscapes show much ability and feeling in their execution.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "George_Cuitt_the_Elder", "word_count": 173, "label": "Painter", "people": "George Cuitt the Elder"}

{"text": "Jerome Williams (born May 10, 1973) is an American retired professional basketball player who last played for the New York Knicks of the NBA. He was a star player on the Magruder High School basketball team. Drafted out of Georgetown University by the Detroit Pistons with the 26th pick of the 1996 NBA Draft (the pick originally belonged to the San Antonio Spurs and went to the Pistons in the Dennis Rodman trade), he played four-plus years with the Pistons, becoming one of their key reserves. He was a fan favorite during his days playing for the Toronto Raptors due to his tenacious efforts on the court. On February 22, 2001 Williams was traded from the Detroit Pistons, along with Eric Montross, to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Corliss Williamson, Tyrone Corbin, Korn\u00e9l D\u00e1vid and a future first-round draft pick. He was so enthusiastic about joining his new teammates that he immediately drove from Detroit to Toronto upon hearing the news. In 2002-03 with the Raptors, Williams averaged 9.7 points per game, primarily as a starter, which has thus far been his career-best scoring average. In 2003, Williams also made a cameo appearance in the Disney Channel Original Movie, Full-Court Miracle. In December 2003 Williams was traded again, this time along with Antonio Davis and Chris Jefferies, to the Chicago Bulls for Jalen Rose, Donyell Marshall and Lonny Baxter. Overall in 2003-04, Williams played in 68 games, starting 44 of them, averaging 6.2 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. During the 2004 offseason, he was involved in yet another trade, one that sent him and Jamal Crawford to the New York Knicks for Dikembe Mutombo, Frank Williams, Othella Harrington and Cezary Trybanski. His relocation to New York meant a relegation to the bench, as his minutes dropped down to around 17 a game. On August 15, 2005, Williams was waived by the Knicks to avoid luxury taxes on his salary, as part of the NBA's new labor agreement. He announced his retirement from his playing career less than 48 hours later. Williams played in 587 games over nine seasons, averaging 6.6 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. Williams joined the NBA's \\\"Basketball Without Borders\\\" program, an effort to teach the game and bring resources to underdeveloped nations in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. In Toronto, he was always greeted with a standing ovation when he returned in a Bulls or Knicks uniform. Nicknamed the Junkyard Dog (or JYD) by Rick Mahorn in his early days as a Detroit Piston for his hard work and hustle (as stated in an interview while he served as a commentator on NBA TV), Williams sometimes referred to himself in the third person. On January 25, 2006, Williams rejoined the Toronto Raptors as their community representative. Williams also played a minor role in the Canadian FBI show, Sue Thomas: F.B. Eye. He played Otis Washington, a dealer turned informant. Williams was hired as Director of Player Development for the national champion Findlay Prep basketball team before becoming assistant coach.  In the summer of 2013, Jerome was promoted to the position of Head Coach at Findlay Prep.

Youngest of three children, he was born and raised in Chicago's historic Pullman area by Italian immigrant parents. Italy, where he returned often, was a common theme through much of his work, such as the series Italy 1974 and White. His noted series Artigiano consists of photographs of tools hand-made by his father.

He attended the graduate program in photography at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, and received a Master of Fine Arts in Photography from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he also taught for 38 years. The following is an excerpt from a statement from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago upon Frank Barsotti's death on June 6, 2012: While teaching at the SAIC, Frank completed his MFA (1969), and a suite of his black-and-white photographs from this period are in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

He was an intrepid maker, and early on, championed alternative and non-silver processes, and what was then considered radical digital processes. Frank was a passionate and dedicated teacher, unafraid to deliver forceful opinions on art and education. He believed strongly in the art school process of dialogue, experimentation, and critique, and this legacy endures in his department and beyond. Though living in Washington State for the [last] 10 years [of his life], Frank was born and raised in Chicago's historic Pullman area and spent the majority of his life in and dedicated to Chicago.

Born in Houston, Texas, Marie Mahoney was the only Houstonian to play in the AAGPBL during its twelve years of existence. \u05f4Red\u05f4, as teammates called her for her hair color, served as fourth outfielder for the two Indiana teams as long as she played in the league. Mahoney began playing softball at age nine. She also competed in basketball, tennis and volleyball, before joining a women's softball team when she turned 16. After graduating from San Jacinto High School, she continued her excellence on the diamond as she became a perennial Texas state ASA all-star, who led her teams to several state championships. She was primarily a pitcher, and after a brief stint at third base, she found her permanent home in the outfield. Thanks to a recommendation by fellow AAGPBL catcher Mary Baker, Mahoney became one of two hundred players to attend the first AAGPBL spring training outside the United States, which was held in Cuba at Gran Stadium de La Habana before the 1947 season. She made the grade and was assigned to the South Bend Blue Sox. In her rookie season, Mahoney hit a .204 average and a .340 of slugging in just 47 games, while ending fifth in triples. She opened 1948 with South Bend but was traded to the Fort Wayne Daisies during the midseason, just in time to help her team reach the playoffs. She batted a combined .140 in 56 games, and went 1-for-5 in two postseason contests. Mahoney later played softball in Houston.

Alderson (October 21, 1914 \u2013 February 11, 2005) was an inventor best known for his development of the crash test dummy, a device that, during the last half of the twentieth century, was widely used by automobile manufacturers to test the reliability of automobile seat belts and other safety protocols. Alderson was born in Cleveland, Ohio but was raised in southern California as a toddler where his Romanian-immigrant father ran a custom sheet-metal and sign shop. He graduated from high school at the age of 15 and went on to intermittently study at Reed College, Caltech, Columbia and UC Berkeley. He frequently interrupted his education to help out with the family sheet-metal business. He completed his formal education at the University of California, Berkeley under the tutelage of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest O. Lawrence, but did not complete his doctoral dissertation. In 1952, he began his own company, Alderson Research Laboratories,and quickly won a contract to create an anthropometric dummy for use in testing aircraft ejection seats. At about the same time, automobile manufacturers were being challenged to produce safer vehicles, and to do so without relying on live volunteers or human cadavers. In 1966, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act was passed, which together with Ralph Nader's book, \\\"Unsafe at Any Speed\\\" put the search for an anatomically faithful test dummy into high gear. With this as a goal, Alderson produced the V.I.P., a dummy designed to mimic an average male's acceleration and weight properties, and to reproduce the effects of impact like a real person. His work went on to see the creation of the Hybrid family of test dummies, which as of the beginning of the 21st century are the de facto standards for testing. Alderson also worked for the United States military. During World War II, he helped develop an optical coating to improve the vision of submarine periscopes, and worked on depth charge and missile guidance technology. He also helped create dummies, known as \\\"medical phantoms\\\", that reacted to radiation, and synthetic wounds, used in emergency training simulations, which behaved like real wounds. Based on that experience, he formed another company that he managed until shortly before his death, Radiology Support Devices, to supply the healthcare industry. Later on, he built dummies to test the Apollo nose cone's water landing capability. Alderson died at his home in Marina Del Rey, California, due to complications from myelofibrosis. Alderson was widowed once and divorced three times.

Educated at Marlborough College, Ferrier started his career as an apprentice at the practice of Aston Webb, but left to start his own practice at the age of just 23. Ferrier spent much of his time in Continental Europe, especially in France, which influenced his work; an avowed Francophile, he published an English-French dictionary of technical terms. He later returned to London, and set up a practice based in Westminster with William Binnie, a former Deputy Director of Works at the Imperial War Graves Commission, in 1927.

Born in Mannheim, Germany in 1911, Wolff emigrated to New York City in 1936, initially working for Alfred Eisenstaedt as a darkroom technician and then starting his own photographic agency, Camera Features. After a brief stint in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, Wolff became a correspondent for the weekly Army magazine, YANK. Wolff reported on major campaigns in Italy and was one of the first to photograph Hitler's mountain retreat in Berchtesgaden after its capture by the Allies. After the war, Wolff returned to New York City and began his career with Black Star. Wolff photographed virtually everything, from famous (and not so famous) people to newsworthy events to technically challenging subjects. His work appeared in the pages of many publications, including Time, Life, Ebony and many others. Wolff also worked for many corporations and educational institutions; his photographs appeared in external publications such as annual reports and alumni magazines. Wolff also documented the official foreign travels of US presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower's eleven-nation tour in 1959,  John F. Kennedy's trip to France in 1961, and  Lyndon B. Johnson's meeting with the South Vietnamese leaders on Guam in 1967. Wolff married Alice H. Eckstein in 1941 before he joined the US Army (allowing him to become a naturalized citizen).

Zelotti came to embody the Veronese tradition on the mainland. He frescoed villas designed by Andrea Palladio, notably Villa Emo and Villa Foscari, where he worked with Bernardino India and Battista Franco: the exact number of Palladian villas he frescoed is not known. With the painter Giovanni Antonio Fasolo he worked also at Villa Caldogno (about 1570) and at Palazzo Porto Colleoni Thiene.

Sundeleaf was born in Portland's Goose Hollow neighborhood in 1900, and moved at age 6 to a neighborhood just north of Sellwood that was then known as City View Park. After graduating from Washington High School in 1918 he attended the University of Oregon's School of Architecture, in Eugene, graduating in 1923. He trained in the Beaux Arts style of traditional design. After graduation he returned to Portland. He began working for the firm of A. E. Doyle in 1923 and remained with Doyle for a year. He then worked for four years with the firm of Sutton and Whitney. After working for other architecture firms, he decided to open his own firm in 1928. During the Great Depression, he worked for the Historic American Buildings Survey. During this time he became known for his imaginative work in industrial architecture. He combined his decorative training with a rugged functionalism in a series of distinctive warehouses and offices. In the 1940s, his style changed somewhat when he became a proponent of the Streamline Moderne style, \\\"in which the spirit of the machine age and the concepts of aerodynamics shaped the design of the building\\\", The Oregonian wrote in its obituary of Sundeleaf. He designed numerous residential and public buildings around Portland. Sundeleaf carried out several projects for Portland-based Jantzen Knitting Mills, including design of a new headquarters building and factory building in Portland, as well as buildings in Australia and England. In 1935 Sundeleaf designed a Tudor style English cottage for the University of Oregon chapter of Chi Psi in Eugene, Oregon. The Chi Psi Fraternity House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1993. Many of Sundeleaf's English cottages would be constructed in suburban Portland. Sundeleaf lived in Lake Oswego, Oregon, from 1940 until his death, and he designed many homes in that area. One of the latter, the Dr. Walter Black House, is listed on the NRHP. Around 1930, Jantzen Knitting Mills co-founder Carl Jantzen also commissioned Sundeleaf to design his home in Oswego (now Lake Oswego), and the now-NRHP-listed Carl C. Jantzen Estate used Sundeleaf's designs for its boathouse and bridge, but another architect designed the main house. Sundeleaf also designed the NRHP-listed 1934 Paul F. Murphy House, in Northwest Portland. With his wife, Mildred, to whom he was married from 1925 until his death, Sundeleaf also owned a 160-acre (65 ha) ranch in southwestern Montana, acquired in 1956.

He is commonly regarded as having performed the first modern psychosurgical operation. Born in Basel, Switzerland, he trained as doctor at the Universities of Basel, G\u00f6ttingen and Berlin, receiving his medical doctorate in 1860. In the same year he took up a teaching post in the University of Basel and established a private practice in his hometown. He married in 1863 but the following year he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and gave up his practice and relocated to a region south of the Pyrennes in search of a cure. By 1866 he had made a full recovery and returned to Basel with the intention of devoting himself to the study of nervous diseases and their treatment. In 1875 he attained a post at the Waldau University Psychiatric Clinic in Bern and from 1876 he lectured on mental diseases at the University of Bern. Beginning in this period, he published widely on his psychiatric and neurological research findings in the medical press developing the thesis that mental illnesses had their origins in specific regions of the brain. In 1882 he was appointed the medical director of a small, modern and privately run psychiatric clinic at Marin in the Swiss Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel where he was provided with a laboratory to continue his research. In 1888 he pioneered modern psychosurgery when he excised various brain regions from six psychiatric patients under his care. Aimed at relieving symptoms rather than effecting a cure, the theoretical basis of the procedure rested on his belief that psychiatric illnesses were the result of specific brain lesions. He reported the results at a Berlin medical conference in 1889 but the reception of his medical peers was decidedly negative and he was ridiculed. Burckhardt subsequently discontinued his research activities. Following the death of his wife in 1896 Burckhardt returned to Basel where he established a sanatorium in 1900.

As a technician fifth grade, he served in France in 1944, and was part of the Allied advance into Germany in May 1945, earning the Silver Star at Jagstfeld. He also received the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman Badge, and battle ribbons with two stars. After being captured by the German forces and as a prisoner of war, Moisan endured a 32-day forced march across Germany into Austria. He suffered frozen feet and his weight dropped from 185 pounds to just 95 pounds. When he was discharged in December 1945, his feet were so tender that he was unable to cope with the infield work required around first base, his normal position, but still wanted to pursue a career in professional baseball. Following his military discharge, Moisan signed with the Chicago Cubs organization as a free agent in the spring of 1946. Due to the nature of his injury and his inability to remain as a first baseman, he had the Cubs' support when he made the decision to transition to a pitcher. Basically a knuckleballer, he also was used in pinch-hitting duties. In his professional debut, Moisan posted a combined record of 15\u201312 and a 3.11 earned run average in 36 games while pitching in the PONY and Tri-State leagues. He would spend the next six years in the minor leagues before gaining a promotion to the majors with the 1953 Cubs. In three relief appearances, he allowed three earned runs on five hits and two walks while striking out one batter in 5.0 innings of work. Moisan's one strikeout came against the great Stan Musial. He did not have a decision. Moisan continued pitching in the minors until 1956. His most productive years came in the Pacific League with the PCL Los Angeles Angels, averaging for them 12 wins per season from 1950 to 1953, with a career-high 16 wins in 1952. In ten minor league seasons, he had a 98\u201396 record with a 3.81 ERA in 329 games, 135 as a starter. A .222 lifetime hitter, he enjoyed his best season in 1953, posting career numbers in average (.284), runs (15), hits (40), home runs (four), RBI (23), OBP (.327) and SLG (.418). During his time with the Los Angeles Angels he was once the roommate of actor and professional athlete Chuck Connors. Following his playing retirement, Moisan remained involved with baseball for a significant number of years, mainly coaching teams near his home in New Hampshire. He also served as the nuclear materials manager at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, retiring in 1985. Moisan died in Brentwood, New Hampshire, at the age of 84.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "BaseballPlayer", "wiki_name": "Bill_Moisan", "word_count": 579, "label": "Baseball Player", "people": "Bill Moisan"}

He is commonly referred to and was addressed as Mies, his surname. Along with Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and Frank Lloyd Wright, he is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of modernist architecture. Mies, like many of his post-World War I contemporaries, sought to establish a new architectural style that could represent modern times just as Classical and Gothic did for their own eras. He created an influential twentieth-century architectural style, stated with extreme clarity and simplicity. His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. He strove toward an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of unobstructed free-flowing open space. He called his buildings \\\"skin and bones\\\" architecture. He sought an objective approach that would guide the creative process of architectural design, but he was always concerned with expressing the spirit of the modern era.

After attending the University of Alabama, Freeman signed with the Red Sox in 1948, and spent five seasons in their farm system before his recall in September 1952. Even though he had pitched exclusively in relief for the Triple-A Louisville Colonels, Freeman was given a starting assignment in his fourth MLB appearance on September 26, 1952. Facing the Washington Senators at Fenway Park, Freeman hurled a complete game, 3\u20131 victory, allowing only four Washington hits. It was Freeman's only complete game in the Majors. He failed to stick with the Red Sox, however, spending most of 1953 and all of 1954 with Louisville. After only two appearances in relief for the 1955 Red Sox, he was placed on waivers at the May cutdown and claimed by the Redlegs. When Cincinnati manager Birdie Tebbetts asked Freeman why the Red Sox waived him, Freeman said Boston had not given him the pitching workload he needed to be effective. \\\"Brother\\\", Tebbetts replied, \\\"you came to the right place.\\\" Tebbetts then used Freeman in relief for 54, 64 and 52 games during the seasons of 1955 through 1957, and Freeman responded by compiling a won\u2013lost record of 28\u201311 with the Redlegs, with 37 saves and an earned run average of 3.33.

{"text": "Arny Freytag (born April 12, 1950) is an American photographer who specializes in glamour photography. He began working for Playboy magazine in 1976 and at one time was one of only two photographers who produced the Playboy centerfold photographs. Freytag grew up in Chicago, Illinois, attending Sutherland grammar school and Luther South High School. He graduated from the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in 1970, and from Brooks Institute of Photography (Santa Barbara, California) in 1974. After an initial period as an apprentice at Playboy, he joined Mario Casilli, Richard Fegley and Ken Marcus as the principal photographers at Playboy\u2019s California studio. During his studies at Brooks, Freytag became proficient with the 4\u201dx5\u201d view camera, a skill that served him well shooting the monthly multi-page (gatefold) Playboy centerfold. Attempting to produce the very highest quality possible for the centerfold image, Playboy used the very large 8\\\"x10\u201d view camera. Due to the amount of strobe (electronic flash) light needed to expose that large a sheet of film, Freytag, at first of necessity and later by choice, specialized in the use of elaborate lighting setups, often using dozens of flash heads. Later, after Playboy abandoned film and moved to digital cameras, Freytag continued to create images using up to fifty flash heads, each light meticulously placed and targeted to illuminate a small area of the photo. Freytag likens his technique to that of a painter, using each light as his brush strokes, selectively illuminating each area as he incrementally builds the final image. Freytag no longer works for Playboy. His last centerfold shoot was of Playmate Amanda Streich, Miss December of 2012. He currently lives in Woodland Hills, California.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Arny_Freytag", "word_count": 277, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Arny Freytag"}

{"text": "Richard William Bartell (November 22, 1907 \u2013 August 4, 1995), nicknamed \\\"Rowdy Richard\\\", was an American shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB). One of the most ferocious competitors of his era, he won both admirers and critics at each stop during a career which saw him traded every few seasons, often under acrimonious circumstances. While hitting .300 over a full season five times, he led the National League in double plays four times and in putouts and assists three times each. From 1927 through 1946, Bartell played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1927\u201330), Philadelphia Phillies (1931\u201334), New York Giants (1935\u201338, 1941), Chicago Cubs (1939) and Detroit Tigers (1940\u20131941). After two years of military service in World War II, he played briefly in 1946 before retiring. At 5'9\\\" and 160 pounds, he batted and threw right-handed. A native of Chicago, who grew up in Alameda, California, Bartell played in three World Series and the 1933 All-Star Game, the first to be played. He had one year in the minors, 1926, with the class A Bridgeport Bears in the Eastern League, where he hit .280 in 148 games. At 19, Bartell was the youngest player in the National League. He appeared in only one game at the end of the season, drawing two walks in four plate appearances. He played flawlessly in the field with five chances and one double play. The Pirates lost to the Yankees in four games and the team had to wait until 1960 to make amends. With an aggressive style of play and fiery attitude which earned him his nickname, Bartell was a competent shortstop with good hands and a strong throwing arm. A skillful hitter, he batted a career-high .320 in 1930. After three seasons over .300 with Pittsburgh, he was traded to the Phillies in 1931, and had collected seasons of 40 doubles and 100 runs three times each by 1934. Bartell helped Philadelphia's perennial cellar-dwellers finish in fourth place in the 1932 season, for the only first-division finish by a Phillies team in a span of 32 seasons (1918\u201342). In 1933 he was elected to the first All-Star Game, and again in 1937. Traded to the New York Giants before the 1935 season, Bartell helped the team win two NL pennants (1936\u201337), and hit .381 in the 1936 World Series. Leading off for the Giants in the Brooklyn Dodgers home opener in 1937, he complained when the first pitch was called a strike \u2013 and was promptly hit in the chest with a tomato thrown from the stands. He later played with the Chicago Cubs in 1939. In 1940, his first season in the American League, he teamed up with second baseman Charlie Gehringer to give the Tigers an AL pennant. Bartell started 1941 with Detroit but returned to the Giants in the midseason as a player-coach. In an 18-season career, Bartell posted a .284 batting average with 79 home runs and 710 runs batted in in 2016 games played. He also finished with 1,130 runs, 2,165 hits, 442 doubles, 71 triples and 109 stolen bases. Bartell later managed in the minor leagues and coached for the Tigers (1949\u201352) and Cincinnati Redlegs (1954\u201355). He died in Alameda at age 87 after suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.

{"text": "Warren T. Thompson (active 1840 - 1870) was an American photographer. Between 1840 and 1846 Thompson worked in Philadelphia and in 1843 refined Daniel Davis Jr.'s electroplating method for colouring daguerreotypes by using a gum tragacanth resist. With this technique colours could be built up in the manner of some types of printmaking. According to an article in the 1892 American Journal of Photography by editor Julius Sachse, Thompson traveled to Paris in 1845 from New York without speaking any French and with an introduction from the Russian Consul in New York to the Russian Vice-Consul in Paris who in turn arranged an introduction to Russian photographer Sergei Lvovich Levitsky. Levitsky is quoted by Sachse as declaring Thompson's daguerreotypes were 'works of art'. Sachse further claims that Thompson influenced for the development of portrait daguerreotypes in Paris. From 1849-50 Thompson was listed as a photographer at 14 boulevard Poissonni\u00e8re, rue Basse-du-Rempart in 1851, then 22 rue de Choiseul from 1853-59. Levitsky returned to Russia by 1849 but came back to Paris by 1859 where he took over Thompson's Choiseul address. This was also the premises for the French arts club. Thompson (aka as surname 'Warren-Thompson'} produced daguerreotypes in Paris as well as very fine stereo daguerreotypes and a number of theatrical self-portraits some of very large size, but his body of known work is scant. The skill of his surviving work suggests he may have trained as a painter.

At midseason, he was selected to the All-Star Futures Game.

{"text": "Simone Pignoni (April 17, 1611 \u2013 December 16, 1698) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He apprenticed with Fabrizio Boschi, then with the more academic and puritanical Domenico Passignano, and finally with Francesco Furini. He is best known for painting in a style reminiscent of the morbidly sensual Furini. Reflective of this obsession is his self-portrait, c. 1650, in which he depicts himself building up a plump naked female from a skeleton. The biographer Baldinucci, in what little he notes of the painter, recalls him as the scandalous \\\"imitator of (Furini's) licentious inventions\\\". A more complete biography was recorded by his pupil Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani. Described as endowed with a \\\"bizarre and amenable intelligence\\\", Pignoni apparently had a late-life conversion to more pious painting. There is one episode recalled that during a serious illness \\\"because in his life he had focused on studying about female forms, and (now) having resigned himself to the impending infinity, his spiritual father urged him to purge those errors with the flame, and once guided by a good disposition, he suddenly was cured by the Lord.\\\" Baldinucci's biography of Furini also recorded a similar, near-death renunciation of his art of the naked figure. Among his more conventional works are a St. Agatha cured by St. Peter (attributed) in the Museo Civico di Trieste; a St. Louis providing a banquet for the poor (c. 1682) now in the church of Santa Felicita in Florence, commissioned by Conte Luigi Gucciardini; and a Madonna and child in glory with archangels Saints Michael and Raphael in battle armor and San Antonio of Padua (1671) for the Cappella di San Michele in Santissima Annunziata. He painted an Allegory of Peace in Palazzo Vecchio. A Penitent Magdalen that has been attributed to Pignoni is found in the Pitti Palace. In San Bartolomeo in Monteoliveto, he painted a Madonna appearing to Blessed Bernardo Tolomeo. In addition to Sagrestani, another pupil was the priest Luca Querci of Cutigliano.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "Simone_Pignoni", "word_count": 327, "label": "Painter", "people": "Simone Pignoni"}
