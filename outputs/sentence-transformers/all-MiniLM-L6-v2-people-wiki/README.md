  - 'Dick de Groot (born 1920) was born in Scheveningen, a beach suburb of The Hague
    in the Netherlands. After the usual schooling that prepared him for the business
    world he decided to follow his old dream of being a painter. He studied five years
    at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and took post-graduate classes in sculpture.
    In 1959 de Groot came to America with his wife Hans and five children. He started
    painting gigantic faces, foaming glasses of beer and entire scenes up to eighty
    feet (24 m) long, for the advertising industry. A good year of this was enough
    and Dick went on his own, doing murals, portraits in oils or bronze, always on
    commission. A long period of involvement in business followed and he kept painting
    in spare time, without the pressure of having to make a living at it. Now, in
    retirement he can do as he pleases and describes his work as follows: I refuse
    to paint \"sure sellers\", such as the cute, the corny, the romantic, the sentimental,
    the narrative. My favorite subject is the contemporary American urban scene, which
    I find exciting and uniquely suited to my taste. I like to use clues that give
    an illusion of space, or only a suggestion of it around the corner or beyond the
    hill. The opposites of mass and space, of volumes and voids intrigue me. They
    are the basis of my compositions. The urban landscape is rich in geometric planes
    that can be arranged in expressive combinations of color and light-dark values.
    I want to see each element in my work in harmony with the total. That includes
    clouds, traffic signs, telephone poles etc. I will change the subject to suit
    my purpose. Things are moved, added or left out in a process of translating reality
    into a painted and new reality, that may be subjectively interpreted.'

    a champion of the Tour de France. Born in Wontergem, Buysse began racing professionally
    in 1914, when he entered the Tour de France but did not finish. He resumed his

    painter who primarily worked and lived in Rome. Nadorp was born in Isselburg into
    a family of artists. He was the only son of Johann Theodor Nadorp and Gertrud
    Anna Stroof. After his education at the Anholt City school, he was joined at age
    20 by a fellowship of his country gentlemen Prince Constantin of Salm-Salm in
    the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, where he trained as a historical painter with
    his teacher Joseph Bergler. Nadorp was the favorite pupil of Bergler. In 1822
    he received the gold medal of the Academy. When in 1826 his mentor died, Nadorp
    broke his tents from Prague and returned in 1827 for a few months in his hometown
    district of Anholt in Isselburg. In the fall of 1827 Nadorp traveled with his
    companions Prince Franz of Salm-Salm to Rome. The city of Rome drew at the time
    many German artists, such as Peter Cornelius, Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Julius
    Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Nadorp was quite fast in the group of German artists,
    called the \"Nazarenes\". He was one of the founders of the Roman Künstlerbund
    (1829) and the German Artists' Union (1845). The years 1840-1850 are among his
    most fertile. Numerous drawings surviving. During this time, Nadorp met the King
    Ludwig I of Bavaria, and they both shared a friendship. 1859 Nadorp was received
    by King Frederick William IV of Prussia, and led to his first government contract.
    Nadorp left Rome only rarely in the nearly 50 years of local work. In 1862 he
    returned for a short time back in his hometown. For his baptismal church of St.
    Pancras, he created an altarpiece The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple and
    drew the located shortly before the demolition of the old town church. In 1876
    Prince Alfred I of Salm-Salm granted him an annuity. Nadorp, which is considered
    a romantic German painter in style, died shortly thereafter in Rome and buried
    at Campo Santo Teutonico next to St. Peter in the Vatican. His entire estate was
    transferred to the Princes of Salm -Salm and can still be seen today in the Museum
    Wasserburg Anholt and in the parish church of St. Pancras.
  - Alex Soler-Roig (born 29 October 1931) is a former racing driver from Barcelona,
    Spain. He participated in 10 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting
    on 19 April 1970, and scored no championship points. He also participated in several
    non-Championship Formula One races. Son of Dr. Soler-Roig, Alex began his career
    with motorcycles before entering the world car racing, participating in rallies
    with Fiat and Porsche. His first victories came in 1958 at the Nuvolari trophy
    in Barcelona and the Rally Catalunya. This allowed him some sponsorship to enter
    the Monte Carlo Rally. In 1968 raced the 24 Hours of Le Mans with team Porsche
    driving a 907/6 Langheck and a year later in the 24 Hours of Daytona, where he
    led his class until his co-driver Rudy Lins had an accident. In the same year
    he finished 4th in the 12 Hours of Sebring with a Porsche 907. That same year
    enters the F2 championship driving a Lola, and in 1969 placed seventh in Barcelona
    Grand Prix in a Lotus F2 from Roy Winckelman Team led by Bernie Ecclestone. Achieved

    in the 1000 km of Buenos Aires. His first race in Formula 1 was at the 1970 Spanish
    Grand Prix with a Lotus 49. Race organisers limited the race to 16 starters, resulting
    in Soler-Roig failing to qualify, despite lapping only a tenth of a second slower
    than Mario Andretti. However, on race morning there was a suggestion that the
    non-qualifiers might be allowed to start after all, so their cars were placed
    on the grid, only for the organisers to stick to their original decision, removing
    Soler-Roig's car from the grid as well as those of Jo Siffert and Andrea de Adamich.
    He subsequently participated at the Belgian Grand Prix, driving the Lotus 72 that
    was meant for Jochen Rindt. However, the car was not ready for Friday´s practice
    and he only managed to complete three laps in Saturday's qualifying, and was therefore
    not allowed to start the race. His final Formula One outing for the season was
    another non-qualification at the French Grand Prix in a 49. He won the Spanish
    GT-Sport Championship that same year. He started the 1971 season driving for the
    works March team, combining the Formula 1 Championship with the Spanish and German
    Touring Car Championships with Ford Capri. He won the Spanish Championship and
    finished fourth in Germany, but failed to finish any races in Formula 1. Soler-Roig
    joined the Marlboro BRM F1 team for the 1972 season, but after a few races with
    problems in the car and the team, decided to spend the rest of the year racing
    the European Touring Car Championship with Ford, getting great results and victories
    in the 24 Hours of Spa, the 24 Hours of Paul Ricard, the 4 Hours of Zandvoort,
    4 Hours of Jarama and the 3 Hours of Montjuich. His withdrawal from the world
    of competition occurred at the end of 1972, before his 41st birthday, to pursue
    his family business.

  - Marcelle Dormoy (1895-1976) was a French couturier, fashion designer, and former
    model active from 1928 to 1950. Dormoy started out as a mannequin for Paul Poiret,
    which she credited with helping her learn to \"understand the female body.\" Dormoy
    worked with Vionnet alongside other designers such as Jacques Griffe and Marcelle
    Chaumont. As première d'atelier, she was head of the workroom at Vionnet until
    she left to launch her own couture house in December 1928. This date was open
    to question even while Dormoy was in business, with M.D.C. Crawford stating in
    1941 that Dormoy launched \"his\" (sic) business in 1934, and the mannequin \"Freddy\"
    recalling a launch date of 1927 in her 1958 memoirs. In 1937 Dormoy had her portrait
    painted by the artist Marie Laurencin, who accepted a fur coat as payment. This
    portrait was sold by the Swiss auction house Dobiaschofsky in 2013. Dormoy remained
    with Jean Patou in Biarritz prior to returning to Paris, France following the
    German occupation of France during World War II. She continued working during
    the Occupation, providing clothes to clients such as the actress Edwige Feuillère.
    In February 1946, Collier's published an article about Feuillère and Dormoy, noting
    that Dormoy's designs were among the first post-war models \"by leading designers\"
    to be bought by American buyers for export back home, despite a poor exchange
    rate meaning that each design cost $500-600. A picture caption in the article
    noted that Dormoy's unfussy designs typically featured free-flowing lines. Dormoy
    closed her house in 1950, and died in 1976. Her heirs presented a 1948 evening
    gown that she had designed to the Musée Galliera.
  - Voris was the professional name of Voris Marker, an American designer of suede
    sportswear who won the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1942 for her work. As Voris
    Marker, she also worked as a sculptor. Born Voris Linthacum in Baker City, Oregon
    according to her marriage certificate, but growing up on a ranch near Billings,
    Montana, Voris worked as a copy-writer for an advertising agency in Chicago after
    finishing school in Montana. While in Chicago, she had to have an operation on
    her leg, which led to her returning home as an invalid. Whilst recuperating, Voris
    came across a piece of soft chamois leather, which inspired her to use it to make
    up clothing. She made a golf skirt for a Spokane woman to wear in a tournament.
    Other players and spectators noticed the skirt, and asked Voris to make them leather
    garments too. She founded her business, Suedes by Voris, in 1933, and by 1940,
    had shops in Hollywood (where she sold garments to many actors) and across the
    South West, selling a wide range of clothing entirely made in suede. Her range
    included day and evening wear, hats, jewelry, and men's jackets, shirts, and ties,
    made in a wide range of colors. One noted design was a gold-plated evening jacket.
    When the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli visited Neiman Marcus and was invited to
    choose any one thing she wanted from the store; she chose a Voris coat as \"the
    most distinctive fashion she had ever seen by an American designer.\" It has been
    suggested that this inspired the decision to award Voris the Neiman Marcus Fashion
    Award in 1942. Voris later gave up the business to dedicate herself to sculpting.
    Following her receipt of the Neiman Marcus award, she was commissioned to create
    a bronze portrait of Herbert Marcus, the co-founder of the store. She made a memorial
    bust of Gary Cooper for the Friars Club of Beverly Hills in 1961. On 29 November
    1936, Voris married Clifford H. Marker (1899–1987) who went on to become President
    of the Board of Water and Power Commissioners in the early 1960s. She died on
    the 22nd May 1973.
  - A painter in the representational manner. Metaphor and allegory figure prominently
    in his oeuvre. His works are layered with multiple meanings — philosophical, political,
    spiritual and erotic — frequently offered in a satirical vein with a wicked sense
    of humor or playful irreverence. A recurrent motif in de Batuc’s work is the Los
    Angeles City Hall, presenting this tall narrow structure in ways that invite political,
    social or even ribald interpretations. Formally de Batuc is concerned with texture,
    space, and chiaroscuro. His works have a strong sense of composition, and his
    application of paint results in a consistently rich and complex surface. His most
    popularly known work is a street mural in Hollywood that pays homage to Dolores
    Del Río one of the golden age of filmdom's most acclaimed beauties. In 2005 Alfredo
    de Batuc was stricken with a severe case of Guillain–Barré syndrome which has
    kept him from active life since, and from which he is slowly recovering.

    "Peter S. Tillotson (born March 23, 1936) is an American former basketball player. He grew up in Ludington, Michigan, and played basketball for Ludington High School from 1951 to 1954. In three years at Ludington High, he scored 1,176 points -- 179 points as a sophomore, 433 points as a junior and 564 points as a senior. During the 1953–54 season, he averaged 25.6 points per game. He led Ludington to a 21–2 record and the state finals in 1952 and an 18–4 record in 1953. As a student at the University of Michigan, he played center for the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team from 1955 to 1958. He was the captain, most valuable player, and leading scorer on the 1957–58 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. He scored 415 points during the 1957–58 season (an average of 18.8 points per game), the second highest point total in Michigan's history to that point. Tillotson was drafted by the Syracuse Nationals in the fifth round (53rd overall pick) of the 1958 NBA draft. He was injured during the pre-season training camp for Syracuse and spent the 1958–59 season playing for the Milan Simmenthal in the Italian Amateur League. He led Milan to a second-place finish for the European championship while averaging 18 points and 11 rebounds. He played for Syracuse in 1960, but his playing career ended after he sustained a knee injury. After retiring from basketball, Tillotson worked for nearly 40 years for Ford Motor Company, Paine Webber, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. He retired in 2001. He was included in the inaugural class of seven athletes inducted into the Mason County Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.",
    "Alfredo Carneros Beamud (born October 7, 1978 in Collado Mediano, Madrid) is a Spanish table tennis player. Carneros narrowly lost the bronze medal to his teammate Carlos Machado in the men's singles at the 2009 Mediterranean Games in Pescara, Italy. As of February 2013, Carneros is ranked no. 215 in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). Carneros is a member of the table tennis team for San Sebastian de los Reyes Sports Club in Madrid, and is coached and trained by Alejandro Maldonado. He is also left-handed, and uses the classic grip. Carneros qualified for the men's singles tournament, as a 29-year-old, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, by receiving an allocation spot from the Final World Qualification Tournament in Budapest, Hungary. He defeated Egypt's Adel Massaad in the preliminary round, before losing out his next match to India's Achanta Sharath Kamal, with a final set score of 2–4.",

  | <code>David Avison</code>                | <code>David Avison (March 13, 1937 – March 7, 2004) was an American photographer and physicist, best known for his use of a wide angle lens to capture nature, crowds, and portraits. Focused on panoramic photography, Avison photographed Chicago's urban landscapes, turning to Chicago's beaches for his contribution to the documentary project Changing Chicago (1987–88, Art Institute of Chicago). Avison spent the bulk of his photographic career in Chicago before moving to Boston in 1997. Avison received his Ph.D. in Physics from Brown University in 1966 and an M.S. in photography from the Illinois Institute of Chicago's Institute of Design. He worked as an instructor of physics at Brown University from 1959 to 1966 and an instructor of physics at Purdue University from 1967 to 1969. Combining his love of physics and photography, Avison designed and built his own panoramic cameras which he used to take all of his photographs.

He studied at the Glasgow School of Art (where he later taught) and was apprenticed to the firm of Gillespie, Kidd and Coia. One of Buchanan Campbell's most notable works was the Dollan Baths complex in East Kilbride (opened 1968). Influenced by the Beaux-Arts style, his time with Coia and works of Pier Luigi Nervi and Kenzo Tange, the significance of Buchanan Campbell's Dollan Baths was recognised when Historic Scotland listed it as Category A in 2002. Other significant work includes Craigie College, Ayr and alterations to Gillespie, Kidd and Coia's Notre Dame College in Bearsden, Glasgow. In 1995 Buchanan Campbell gifted his papers to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. He was married to Sheila (Neville- Smith) Campbell, they had one daughter, Alexis Louise Leech, and one son, Euan Buchanan Campbell.</code>                                 | <code>1.0</code> |

As early as 1911, he began to play an active role in the Laberte-Humbert Frères company. The Laberte workshop produced large range of instruments and bows consistent in quality, employed over 300 people by 1920. In addition, many skilled master makers worked for Laberte, including Camille Poirson, Charles Brugere, and Georges Apparut. The workshop owned a fine collection of instruments from all the famous makers including Antonio Stradivari, Guarneri del Gesù, Giuseppe filius Andrea Guarneri, Francesco Ruggeri, Nicolas Lupot, Jacob Stainer, and Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. They were meticulously examined and used as models for their own instruments. The workshop was disrupted in the war, and productions resumed after the war ended. The workshop continued for several years before it eventually closed down.</code>                                                 | <code>1.0</code> |
